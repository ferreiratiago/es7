I keep saying this but it's really confusing talking about ES7 being ECMAScript 2016.

We could have waited one year and have ECMAScript version align with the year.

Just a though!

As for ES7 (ECMAScript 2016), here it is:
* [Array.prototype.includes](array.js)
* [Exponentiation Operator](exponentiation.js)
